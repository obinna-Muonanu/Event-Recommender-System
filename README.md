# Comedy Event-Recommender-System
## Project Description
An Abuja-based online Comedy TV aims to optimize its content using customer ratings, sourced from popular comedy shows held across Nigeria. The company needs to identify which content is most valuable based on customer ratings and provide a personalized experience by delivering the most relevant comedy content to each viewer. The dataset includes anonymous ratings ranging from -5 to 5 given by followers of the comedy station. The goal of this project is to leverage users' past preferences to predict ratings for events that viewers have not rated yet and provide recommendations based on the similarity of events they have rated previously.

## Data Source

This project uses the Recommendation Engine Creation Challenge on Zindi.
